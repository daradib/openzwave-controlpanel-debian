 * Consider making and contributing some changes upstream.
  - Add manpage.
  - Update Makefile. Use conditionals to support different platforms
    instead of manually commenting/uncommenting lines.
  - Listen on localhost instead of all interfaces and make this configurable.
  - Use mkstemp instead of mktemp in webserver.cpp to fix a gcc warning.
 * Add a watch file if upstream starts making releases (GitHub #51).
