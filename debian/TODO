 - Add manpage for ozwcp binary
   (lintian binary-without-manpage).
 - Change CFLAGS and LDFLAGS in Makefile
   (lintian hardening-no-bindnow, hardening-no-fortify-functions).
 - Consider patching webserver.cpp to use mkstemp instead of mktemp
   and forward change upstream. This would fix a gcc warning.
 - Add a watch file if upstream starts making releases (GitHub #51).
